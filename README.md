# SONOS for NodeRED

A set of nodes to control SONOS via NodeRED. Uses the sonos [NPM Module](https://github.com/bencevans/node-sonos).

Currently early alpha version ... development ongoing.

Open points / not tested yet:
* manipulating playlists
* zone configurations
* controlling stereo and or surround configurations
* automatic detection of play configuration

Known issues:
* status is only set according to input, not requested from player

Planned upcoming features:
* annoucement node (should play a jingle or a text to speech thing and then continue with current playlist)

## Installation

`npm install node-red-contrib-sonos`

## Implemented Nodes

Control - controls one SONOS player, by reacting on a JSON payload.
Available modes:
* `"mode":play,pause,stop`
* `"track":next,previous`
* `"volume":1..100,mute,unmute`

Current Track - returns the currently played track

Queue - controls one SONOS player, by reacting on a JSON payload.
Available modes:
* `"songuri":<uri of the song to be queued>`
* `"position":0..<max_queue_length>,next`

Group - controls join or leave of a group. The node itself represents the "master".
Master node is also the one play stop and other activities will continue to work.
Available modes:
* `"action":join,leave`
* `"otherNode":<ip address of the node to join or to leave>`
